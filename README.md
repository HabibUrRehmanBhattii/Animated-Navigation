# Animated Navigation
    This is a simple animated navigation bar using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
    The navigation bar is responsive and works on all devices.
    The navigation bar is animated from the left side and when closed it slides back to the left side. The Advanced CSS is used to make the navigation bar responsive.
    The navigation bar is animated using JavaScript. The JavaScript is used to toggle the navigation bar when the menu button is clicked. The JavaScript is also used to close the navigation bar when the close button is clicked. The for loop is used to loop through the navigation links and add an event listener to each link. The event listener is used to close the navigation bar when a navigation link is clicked. The JavaScript is only 40 lines of code.
